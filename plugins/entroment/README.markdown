# Entroment

"Entropia mentalis" &mdash; loss of mental clarity

A two field note system with - surprise - an inbuild spaced repetition
system purely in Ruby.


## Notes? Spaced Repetition? Surely This Will Be Simple...


Oh, you sweet summer child. The idea was brilliant—nay, revolutionary:
jot down a note (two fields, content and tags), slap on the right
tags, and voilà, your Anki deck updates itself across all devices.
Fast, clean, efficient. What could possibly go wrong?

"Anki is amazing!" they said. "It’ll change your life!" they lied.
Turns out, Anki has the perfect system for making you question your
life choices. Sure, you can create decks, and if you enjoy performing
digital seppuku, you can sync them to the cloud via an inscrutable
online service, then pull them back down like some medieval monk
copying manuscripts. But updating decks? Forget it. Oh, and they have
a sync server written in Rust (because, of course, they do). It’s
fast, modern, and still completely useless since the issue is the same
- you can’t update decks without a running anki application

After hours of research, gallons of tears, and the slow, soul-sucking
realization that my dreams were crumbling into the void, I did the
only sane thing: I poured a blood orange juice, explained the
situation to my dogs and that it will take a few days, and wrote my
own damn SM2 system.

It might be not as extensive as anki, but it will have *MULTIPLE* apis
and many (!) different ways to access cards.
