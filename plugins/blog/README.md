# Blog

So, you want to blog? Join the club! This plugin provides all the
digital ink and paper you'll need to share your thoughts with the
world, or at least, with whoever stumbles upon your site.

## What it Does

The Blog plugin allows you to create, manage, and display blog posts.
It's designed to be straightforward but flexible enough for your
musings, rants, and groundbreaking manifestos.

Key features include:

*   **Markdown Support:** Write your posts in Markdown, because who has time for complicated editors?
*   **Image Handling:** Easily add images to your posts to make them less text-wall-y.
*   **Tags:** Organize your posts with tags, making it easier for readers (and you) to find specific topics.
*   **Drafts & Publication:** Write now, publish later. Or never. We don't judge.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Supports writing posts in multiple languages.

So go ahead, start blogging! The internet awaits your wisdom.
